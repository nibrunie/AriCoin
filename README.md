# AriCoin
Crypto currency with useful proof of work: listing hardest to round cases


# Introduction
AriCoin is a simple crypto-currency. Currency exchange are registered into a blockchain, in a similar manner to bitcoin.
Most crypto-currencies are based on proof-of-work: solving a hard algorithm challenge is required to validate a block of transaction, thus integrating them into the growing chain of transactio blocks.
The reward for validating the transaction, and solving the hard challenge, is given as a currency reward to the crypto currency minors.
This work is energy consuming and apart from validating transactions, the challenge responses are useless.

AriCoin has been designed to provide both a blockchain to log transactions and a useful proof of work: namely searching hardest to round cases.
Contrary to must crypto-currencies the proof-of-work challenges.
